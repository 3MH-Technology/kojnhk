"""Server-side guard when building the system prompt from stored pieces.

Mitigations applied here:
- Strip user-controlled substrings that try to impersonate system messages.
- Reject obvious prompt-injection patterns from the *content* of memory items
  (these are user-curated, but a malicious past-self may have written junk).
- Enforce a hard size cap on the assembled system prompt.
- Never embed raw user messages inside the system block.
